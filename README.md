\# 🚦 Smart Traffic Management System (AI Powered)



An AI-based intelligent traffic control and monitoring system using \*\*Computer Vision + YOLOv8\*\* for real-time traffic management.



This project simulates a \*\*Smart City Traffic Control Center\*\* with:

\- Traffic density analysis  

\- Adaptive signal control  

\- Emergency vehicle management  

\- Accident detection  

\- Pothole detection  

\- Green corridor system  

\- AI-based lane prioritization
